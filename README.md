# Weather Dashboard

# Description
Weather-Dashboard is an application to find a weather condition of a given city, both the current and 5-Day forecast at the same time. The server-side API used to get response data object is retrieved from the Open Weather API. The Open Weather API pulls a location's temperature, UV index, humidity, windspeed, and associated weather icon. A color badge will display depending on which category the UV index falls into: low, medium, or high. Previously searched locations are saved to local storage and can be accessed from the search input dropdown.
